# Frontend Development

Quasar is the framework we are using for the frontend, why? it is easy, fast and well documented.

## Install the dependen
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

# Backend Development

The idea of the backend is to use [supabase](https://supabase.io/), it is an excellent open source tool to create a backend without much effort, well documented and with a large community.
